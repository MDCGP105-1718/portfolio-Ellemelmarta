    Starts up an interactive game of Hangman.

    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many
      letters the secret_word contains and how many guesses s/he starts with.

    * The user should start with 6 guesses

    * Before each round, you should display to the user how many guesses
      s/he has left and the letters that the user has not yet guessed.

    * Ask the user to supply one guess per round. Remember to make
      sure that the user puts in a letter!

    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
      about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.

    * After each guess, you should display to the user the
      partially guessed word so far.

    Follows the other limitations detailed in the problem write-up.
